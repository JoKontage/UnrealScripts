# What's in here?
Scripts primarily for the Insurgency: Sandstorm UE 4.25 editor.

- setup_sandstorm_map.py: used for setting up Checkpoint for DoI map ports; not for general use, but dirty reference for others
- unreal_tkinter_ui.py: example of how we can use the Tkinter library to create Editor tools that have the flexibility of Python
- unreal.py: dump of Python bindings in the UE 4.25 Sandstorm Editor for IDE autocompletion and reference
